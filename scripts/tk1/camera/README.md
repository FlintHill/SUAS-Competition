README

This program grabs frames from a Flea3 camera, extracts objects, then saves
the cropped objects to a "crops" directory specified in the code. To run this,
follow the below instructions:

1 - run 'sh build.sh' to get the cropper executable (this also cleans all directories)
2 - run './cropper [pixels per inch]'
