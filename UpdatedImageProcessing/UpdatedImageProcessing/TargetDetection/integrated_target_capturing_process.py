        Crop the single targets with information given by target_location.

        Concept:
        Stage 1
        Find the average color of the target_map.

        Stage 2
        For every detected target on the target map:
        1. Crop it out with 30-pixel margins on each side.
        2. Find the average_corner_color of the image.
        3. Find the rim_average_color of the image.

        if the average_corner_color is not within 15 percent difference from the
        rim_average_color, the target is determined as a false positive and is
        added to list_to_eliminate.
        Otherwise, proceed to to Stage 3.

        Stage 3
        Apply BackgroundColorNullifier.nullify_color_and_recrop_target to the
        image. For more detail see .background_color_nullifier.
