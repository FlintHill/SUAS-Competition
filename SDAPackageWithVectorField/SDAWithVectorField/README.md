This is an alternative method for SDA.


For the current SDA, we draw squares and static points around obstacles and connect them to make paths.

However, this package uses vector math to caculate waypoints and create a path with a series of points.
The package is not completed. 
All the baseline methods are finished, but it still needs tests and tweaks to before final installation.



To test and visualize the package, please go to VectorFieldSDASimualtor package for further information.
