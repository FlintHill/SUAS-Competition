chdkptp supports console CLI, a GUI, and batch operation.

The GUI is still unfinished

Some additional information is available from the assembla project wiki:

CLI information:

Scripting:

=Installing=
See INSTALL.TXT

=Invoking=
The interface is selected by command line options, described below.

==Running under linux==
Under linux, the .lua files will not automatically found relative to the
executable directory. You can set LUA_PATH on the command line to allow them
to be located:
$ LUA_PATH="/path/to/chdkptp/lua/?.lua" /path/to/chdkptp ...

Similarly, if the IUP and CD shared libraries are not on the default system
path, you must also set LD_LIBARARY_PATH
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/iup LUA_PATH="/path/to/chdkptp/lua/?.lua" /path/to/chdkptp -g

It is suggested that you put all this in a shell script, see chdkptp-sample.sh
for an example.

You may need to make permission changes to allow users other than root to open
the USB device. Some notes can be found in this forum post:
http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php?topic=6231.msg89252#msg89252

==Command line==
Usage: chdkptp [options]
Options:
 -g  start GUI - default if GUI available and no options given
 -i  start interactive CLI
 -c  connect at startup, with optional device spec e.g. -c"-d001 -bbus-0"
 -e  execute CLI command, multiple allowed, e.g -e"u DISKBOOT.BIN" -ereboot
 -r  specify startup command file, if no file given skip default startup files
 -h  help

If invoked with no options, the GUI will be started if available.  Otherwise,
the CLI will be started.

If started with options and neither -g nor -i is given, chdkptp will run in
batch mode, exiting after performing the actions specified by the options.

When using -e, -c or -r, the values must immediately follow the option, without
any space, e.g. -rmyfile or -r=myfile, not -r myfile. If any arguments that 
include spaces, they must be quoted.

==Startup files==
Startup files can be used to automatically execute CLI commands at startup.
Using the exec command, you may also execute arbitrary lua.

If the -r command line option is used, it is treated as the full name of the
file, and the default files are ignored. If -r is given without a filename,
no startup file is used. 

If -r is not used, CHDKPTP checks for startup files using the CHDKPTP_HOME
environment variable, or if that is not set, the HOME environment variable.

.chdkptprc (linux) / _chdkptprc (windows) is the default startup file in CLI
or batch mode.

.chdkptpguirc (linux) / _chdkptpguirc (windows) is the default startup file
in GUI mode. This is run after the gui module is loaded, but before the GUI
is started.

=CLI=
CLI commands are available from the console, GUI and the command line

Many CLI commands have full descriptive name and a short name. The short 
is listed in parenthesis in the command reference below.

==CLI parsing==
The cli commands lua, luar, exec and putm all accept a single line of free-form
text and pass it unmodified to the underlying function.

Most other commands parse the remaining input into switches and arguments
Switches are in the for -switchname and may take values with -switch=value
Arguments are any other sequence of non-space or quoted characters.

Both switches and words may be quoted as follows:
The characters " or ' can be used to quote arguments or switch values that
contain spaces. Inside double quotes "",  backslash \ is treated as an escape
character.

==Command reference==
output of help -v
help (h)     [cmd]|[-v]  : - help on [cmd] or all commands
 help -v gives full help on all commands, otherwise as summary is printed

   -fmatch=<pattern> only file with path/name matching <pattern>
   -rmatch=<pattern> only recurse into directories with path/name matching <pattern>
   -maxdepth=n       only recurse into N levels of directory (default 1, only those specified in command)
   -ext=string       only files with specified extension, default dng, * for all. Not a pattern
 commands:
   mod dump save info listpixels
  take the same options as the corresponding standalone commands
  load and unload are implicitly called for each file

==Runtime options==
The set command allows you to set the following runtime options
cli_time=false       - boolean: show cli execution times
cli_xferstats=false  - boolean: show cli data transfer stats
cli_verbose=1        - number: control verbosity of cli
cli_source_max=10    - number: max nested source calls
warn_deprecated=true - boolean: warn on deprecated libraries
core_verbose=0       - number: ptp core verbosity
err_trace=critical   - string: stack trace on error, values: 'always', 'critical', 'never'

In the GUI, the following additional options are available:
gui_live_sched=false - boolean: use scheduler for live updates
gui_live_dropframes=false - boolean: drop frames if target fps too high
gui_dump_palette=false - boolean: dump live palette data on state change
gui_context_plus=false - boolean: use IUP context plus if available
gui_force_replay_palette=-1 - number: override palette type dump replay, -1 disable
gui_verbose=1        - number: control verbosity of gui
gui_dev_check_interval=500 - number: connection/device list check time in ms, 0=never
gui_shoot_half_timeout=3000 - number: max time to wait for shoot_half, in ms

Notes:
1) Outside of startup files, setting a gui option when the gui is not running
   is currently an error
2) gui_context_plus must be set in a startup file to take effect.
3) gui_live_dropframes defaults to true under Linux

=Examples=
start chdkptp in interactive mode and connect to the first available camera
 chdkptp -i -c

execute lua on host PC and print the result
con> !return 1+1
=2

execute lua on the camera, and print the result
con> =return get_buildinfo()
1:return:table:{platformid=12732,platform="d10",version="CHDK",platsub="100a",build_number="0.9.9",os="dryos",build_date="May  3 2011",build_time="20:54:20",}

upload diskboot.bin to A/diskboot.bin, reboot camera, enter interactive mode
 chdkptp -c -e"u bin/diskboot.bin" -ereboot -i

upload interval.lua to A/CHDK/SCRIPTS/interval.lua, from the command line
 chdkptp -c -e"u interval.lua CHDK/SCRIPTS/"

download A/CHDK/CCHDK.CFG to BACKUP.CFG in the current directory
 chdkptp -c -e"d CHDK/CCHDK.CFG BACKUP.CFG"

connect to the device with name containing D10 on bus "bus-0", 
 chdkptp -c"D10 -b=bus%-0" -i
note connect -b takes a lua pattern by default, so % is used to escape the -

download all images from the DCIM directory to a corresponding tree in c:/images
con> imdl -ddir=c:/images

download all images from the DCIM directory to c:/images/, into directories
organized by date
con> imdl -d=c:/images/${mdate,%Y/%m/%d}/${name}

download and delete images with numbers between 3060 and 3070 from DCIM/100CANON
con> imdl -imin=3070 -imax=3080 -rm DCIM/100CANON

download some jpeg images (in 100CANON etc folders)
con> mdl -fmatch=%.JPG$ DCIM C:\temp

delete some raw images
con> rm -nodirs -fmatch=%.CRW$ DCIM

upload some scripts
con> mup c:\CHDK\SCRIPTS CHDK/SCRIPTS

ad hoc scripting on PC side - download some files
con> !t=con:listdir('A/DCIM/100CANON',{match="%.JPG$"})
con> !for i,n in ipairs(t) do con:download("A/DCIM/100CANON/"..n,"C:/TEMP/"..n) end
NOTE the mdownload cli command above is probably more convenient

==Run a script file on the camera==
The suggested way to run a lua script file on the cameras is

con> .loadfile('A/CHDK/SCRIPTS/MY.LUA')()

loadfile returns a function, the following () executes it immediately.

The reason to loadfile instead of the more obvious dofile() or require() is
that code executed in these functions cannot yield, which means you wouldn't
be able to use sleep or keyboard functions.

If the script was written to be loaded from the CHDK script menu and expects
menu settings, you will need to manually set the corresponding variables, e.g.

con> .a=1; b=2; loadfile("A/CHDK/SCRIPTS/MY.LUA")()

While the script is running you will not be able to control the camera from
chdkptp using the GUI key buttons or any other script commands. You also will
note be able to gracefully terminate the script without physically pressing the
shutter button.

If you want to have a script that runs for a long time on the camera, but still
be able to control it over ptp, you will probably need to write your own script
using the ptp message interface. Some examples of this in the chdkptp lua code
lua/rlibs.lua msg_shell and lua/multicam.lua

==Grabbing images from the camera display==
lvdumpimg can be used capture the viewfinder (viewport) and UI (bitmap) from
the camera display. The output may be saved to files or piped to the standard
input of another process.

The -vp and -bm options are used to specify the output files or pipe commands.

The -pipevp and -pipebm options are used to indicate that -vp or -bm specifies
a command to pipe to rather than a file.

By default, a new process is started for each frame. To send all frames to a
single process, pass oneproc to the pipe option, like -pipevm=oneproc

It is not currently possible to pipe both viewport and bitmap data to the same
process.

The viewport is saved before the bitmap, so if oneproc is not used, commands
for the bitmap may also access the previously saved viewport data.

By default substitution patterns of the form ${foo} may be used to generate
unique files names using the date, time captured frame counter. Substitutions
may be disabled using -nosubst.

Some examples:
Grab 10 viewport frames to files organized in date and time directories
lvdumpimg -vp=vp_${date,%Y%m%d}/${date,%H%M%S}/${frame}.ppm -count=10

Grab a single viewport frame, use imagemagick to convert to jpeg, re-size to 640x480
and naming by date and time:

lvdumpimg -vp='convert - -resize 640x480! vp_${date,%B_%d_%Y-%H_%M_%S}.jpg' -pipevp -count=1

NOTE:
On windows, convert conflicts with system file. You might need to use a full path.

Capture viewport and bitmap, and merge them into a single PNG:
lvdumpimg -pipebm -count=3 -vp=tmp.ppm -bm='convert tmp.ppm - -resize 640x480! -layers merge merged_${frame}.png'

pipe 100 frames of viewport to ffmpeg and stream over rtp 
lvdumpimg -pipevp=oneproc -count=100 -vp='ffmpeg -vcodec pgm -f image2pipe -i - -vcodec mpeg2video -s 640x480 -r 24 -pix_fmt yuv420p -f rtp rtp://127.0.0.1:1234'

NOTE:
You could use VLC and open rtp://127.0.0.1:1234 to watch the stream
These probably aren't the best parameters to use
